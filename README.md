# Kald-s-BitCoin-Calculator
Kald's BitCoin calculator that's based on Node.JS
Allows the user to input a desired BitCoin value and convert it to a desired currency.
<br>
After the user has entered the desired value and has chosen the desired currency to convert the value to,
the application proceeds to contact the CoinDesk API service to retrieve the current exchange rate for the currency user
has chosen to convert to.
<br>
Note that the application currently only supports converting to either Euros or U.S Dollars.
There are currently no plans to add support for more currencies to this application.
